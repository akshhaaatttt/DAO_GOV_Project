The app features **real-time data updates** with **Supabase**, wallet integration with **Freighter**, and seamless interactions with the Stellar testnet.

## 🧭 How It Works

1. 🔗 **Connect Wallet** – Users must connect their **Freighter wallet** to interact with the DApp.
2. 🧾 **Register as a Member** – New users must register by paying a **one-time fee of 10 XLM**. This ensures commitment and reduces spam.
3. 📝 **Create Proposals** – Only **registered members** can create proposals. Each proposal creation costs **5 XLM** to discourage unnecessary submissions.
4. ✅ **Vote on Proposals** – Registered members can vote **YES or NO** on active proposals. Each vote requires a **0.5 XLM fee**.
